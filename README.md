# Twitter-Data-Scraper-

This project was created as a part of the Network Contagion Research Group + New Jersey Governor STEM Scholars: Social Cyber
Forensics Lab Coding Challenge. 

This Python script scrapes a given Twitter page and generates a random tweet. That tweet is then compared with an interest to view how the two parameters are related.
